# Dynamic mac-like wallpaper and lockscreen</br>
Dynamically changing desktop by the hours of the day.</br>
To get a perspective what dynamic desktop is, check [this website](https://dynamicwallpaper.club/)</br>
</br>
I've created the blured images by [this script](https://github.com/Vergil333/dynamic-mac-like-wallpaper-and-lockscreen/blob/master/create_blur.sh). If you want softer/harder blur, just edit the script and run it.<\br>
### Requirements
- Ubuntu with Gnome (probably other distros works too)
- [Gnome Tweaks](https://itsfoss.com/gnome-tweak-tool/)
</br>
### Installation
- clone this repository
- in /desktop/mojave.xml and /lockscreen/lockscreen_mojave.xml change all of the pats to the images to your actual path and save the files.
- go to gnome tweaks -> Appearance -> Background/Lock Screen -> Image and put the xml files in there.
